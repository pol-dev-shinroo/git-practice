## What is git?

<em><span style="color: #FF7F50; font-size: 26px">"GIt</span> is software for **tracking changes** in any set of files,</br> usually used for **coordinating work** among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development<em><span style="color: #FF7F50; font-size: 26px">"</span></em></em>

**âˆ´** **<span style="color: #FF7F50;">Git is a version control system</span>**

## so how does git works?

-   **Repository** is a container for a project which can be stored locally or on a website such as github (remote repository)
-   **Working directory** is where you are working on a project in the local computer. You can save changes while modifying your project but they are **not yet tracked**, thus not ready for commit
-   **Git add** command adds change in the working directory to the **staging area** ready for commit
-   **Commits** are **save points** for the project. commit **hashes** are unique key generated by git. **commit history** saves all the commits (ex. **tracked changes** implemented in the project)
-   **Git push** **uploads** commits to the remote repository at Github
-   **Git pull** **fetch and download** changes from the remote repository to local repo

## git workflows

git workflow is **best-practice** for how to use Git in a **consistent** and **effective** manner. </br> There are many ways.

One typical way is the following:

-   clone or pull latest change from the main
-   create a new branch for fixing bug
-   modify the files in your local computer
-   commit changes to your branch
-   squash all commits into one single commit and get reviewed (once PR)
-   merge to main branch (from this point you can delete the branch)

**Merge Conflict**
because main branch will move on as you are working on your branch, there are times where your PR will face "merge conflict issue"
(especially when the changes are made in same lines)
